Hello, 

We will be taking a look at Apache Cassandra/Redis. Downloads relating to it is located at

---- PLAYING WITH DATA
Let’s start adding some data into Redis and modify that data. We’ll create a basic key name “firstkey” by running the following command:
SET firstkey “1”

We’ve set the value of 'firstkey' to 1. We can confirm this by running the 'GET' command
get firstkey

we can update our key’s value by incrementing it
INCR firstkey
get firstkey

---- MODELING DATA
MySQL - users table ( a representation of a row )
HMSET user:1 id 1 username alexbraunton password a67b9b40f76 email alex@example.com verified Y

We can check that the hash has been added to the server by running the “KEYS *” command:
KEYS *

Let’s check the hash and see our values:
HGETALL user:1

If you just need to see the available keys (and not the values) of a hash then you can run the “HKEYS” command:
HKEYS user:1

To get a specific value, we can access it by its key using the “HGET” command:
HGET user:1 email

The user wants to update their email address which can be done by using the “HMSET” command:
HMSET user:1 email "alex_new@example.com"

Let’s say one of our users needs to be deleted from Redis
DEL user:1
