################### Triggers ###################
# stored program executed automatically to respond to a specific event e.g.,  insert, update or delete occurred in a table. The main difference between a trigger and a stored procedure is that a trigger is called automatically when a data modification event is made against a table whereas a stored procedure must be called explicitly
